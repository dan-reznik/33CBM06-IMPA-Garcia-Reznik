 

History of experiment. Phone call with Ronaldo, graph of $r/R$, Feuerbach's thm implies sum of cosines. Phone call with Jair about $N=4$, supplementary angles, sum of cosines vanishes. generalization for all $N$. Tried $N=5$ and it worked.

Dominique placed an expression as youtube comment for $r/R$ which we recognized as $J L - 3$ given ronaldo's explicit expressions for J and L. We tried $J L - N$ and it worked for all $N$.
