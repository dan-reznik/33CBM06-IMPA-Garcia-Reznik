\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
Calculate the elliptic billiard aspect ratio $a/b$ such that top and bottom vertices of the elliptic locus of $X_3$ coincide each with the billiard top and bottom vertices. Repeat for the locus of $X_5$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Calculate the elliptic billiard aspect ration $a/b$ such that the locus of $X_4$ is identical to a $90^\circ$ rotated copy of billiard.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Over billiard 3-periodics, the envelope of the Euler line is an astroidal-like curve with four cusps, see it \href{https://bit.ly/3yiCvrn}{Live}. Derive its equation. Also, find the elliptic billiard aspect ratio $a/b$ such that the top and bottom cusps of said curve coincide each with top and bottom vertices of the elliptic billiard.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Express in terms of $a,b$ of the elliptic billiard, the coordinates of the endpoints of the obtuse ``zones'' labeled $P_i^{\perp}$, $i=1,2,3,4$ in  \cref{fig:04-obtuse-zones}.
\end{exercise}

\section{Research}

\begin{question}
Concerning the locus of $X_{59}$ over billiard 3-periodics (\cref{fig:04-x59-locus}, determine:
\begin{itemize}
\item An implicit and/or parametric equation;
\item The locations of its four self-intersections;
\item The $a/b$ such that if $X_{59}$ is on a self-intersections on the elliptic billiard minor axis, the 3-periodic is a right triangle? (it is close to $1.58$, see \cref{fig:04-x59-locus}(right).
\end{itemize}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Prove that over billiard 3-periodics traversed continuously, the vertices of the extouch triangle, i.e., the 3 extouchpoints, will move in the same direction as 3-periodic vertices, whereas the Feuerbach point will move in the opposite direction.
