\begin{exercise}
Calculate the elliptic billiard aspect ratio $a/b$ such that top and bottom vertices of the elliptic locus of $X_3$ coincide each with the billiard top and bottom vertices. Repeat for the locus of $X_5$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Calculate the elliptic billiard aspect ration $a/b$ such that the locus of $X_4$ is identical to a $90^\circ$ rotated copy of billiard.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Over billiard 3-periodics, the envelope of the Euler line is an astroidal-like curve with four cusps, see it \href{https://bit.ly/3yiCvrn}{Live}. Derive its equation. Also, find the elliptic billiard aspect ratio $a/b$ such that the top and bottom cusps of said curve coincide each with top and bottom vertices of the elliptic billiard.
