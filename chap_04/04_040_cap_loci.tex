In the previous chapter we toured loci phenomena for billiard 3-periodics. Here we continue this exploration for other for 3-periodic families in other concentric, axis-aligned ellipse pairs.

A list of the elliptic loci of centers in the $X_{1}$ to $X_{200}$ range can be found \href{https://dan-reznik.github.io/why-so-many-ellipses/}{here}.
