\begin{question}
Consider the family of inversive images of excentral 3-periodics with respect to a circle centered at a point $M$ in the plane. Show the symmedian point $X_6$ of such a family will be stationary regardless of $M$. Compute the location of $X_6$. See it in this video \href{https://youtu.be/wwX_QfkjVi0}{Video}.
