In the previous chapter we toured loci phenomena for billiard 3-periodics. Here we continue this exploration for other for 3-periodic families in other concentric, axis-aligned ellipse pairs, shown in \cref{fig:06-six-caps}.

Recall Cayley's condition for a CAP pair to admit a Poncelet 3-periodic family: $a_c/a+b_c/b=1$, where $a>b>0$, $a_c>0$, and $b_c>0$.
