\begin{question}
Recall the extouch triangle has vertices at the points of contact of the excircles with a triangle's sidelines \cite[Extouch triangle]{mw}. 
In \cref{chap:05-confocal-loci} we show that the vertices of the extouch triangles of billiard 3-periodics coincide with the caustic touchpoints, see it 
\href{https://bit.ly/33PufRv}{Live}. Show that said extouch family is also Ponceletian and concentric with the elliptic billiard; derive expressions for the semi-axes of its elliptic caustic. Is its center a triangle center?
