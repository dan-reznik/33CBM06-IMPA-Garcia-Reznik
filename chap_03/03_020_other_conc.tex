Below we introduce five additional notable 3-periodic Poncelet families interscribed between a pair of concentric, axis-parallel (CAP) ellipses. As before, the Cayley condition \cref{eqn:n3-cayley} will be used to constrain the ellipse pair.

    \caption{\textbf{Left:} billiard 3-periodic (blue) and its excentral triangle (green). The former conserves the sum of its cosines.

    \label{fig:03-n3-affine}
\end{figure}

\section{Excentral Family}

This is the Ponceletian family of excentral triangles to billiard 3-periodics. If the axes of its caustic are $a,b$, this family is inscribed in an ellipse with $a_e,b_e$ given in \cref{thm:02-incenter-excenter}; see \cref{fig:03-n3-affine}(left). Indeed, by inverting the relations in the latter, we can express $a,b$\footnote{There is a slight abuse of notation in that these should have been labeled $a_c,b_c$. However we maintained these as $a,b$ since the caustic to the excentral family is the elliptic billiard.} in terms of $a_e,b_e$:

\begin{proposition}
Given the semi-axes $a_e$, $b_e$ of $\mathcal{E}_e$ the semi axis of the caustic $\mathcal{E}$ are given by:
\[a=\frac{(\delta_e- a_e^2 - 3b_e^2) a_e}{2 c_e^2},\;\; b=\frac{(3a_e^2 + b_e^2 - \delta_e)b_e}{2 c_e^2}\]
where $c_e^2=a_e^2-b_e^2$ and $  \delta_e=\sqrt{a_e^4 + 14a_e^2b_e^2 + b_e^4}$.
\label{prop:03-excentral-caustic}
\end{proposition}

The symmedian point $X_6$ of the excentral triangle coincides with the mittenpunkt of its reference, see \cite[X(6)]{etc}. Therefore:

\begin{corollary}
Over excentral 3-periodics, the symmedian point $X_6$ of the excentral family is stationary.
\end{corollary}

Recall that in \cref{cor:02-rOvR} two other notable invariants are mentioned: product of internal angle cosines, and ratio of its area by billiard 3-periodics.

\begin{corollary}
The invariant product of cosines of excentral 3-periodics is a quarter of the quantity in \cref{cor:02-rOvR}. Furthermore the area ratio of billiard 3-periodics by excentrals is half the quantity in \cref{cor:02-rOvR}.
\end{corollary}

Let $s_i'$ denote the variable sidelengths of the excentral family, $i=1,2,3$. Here is an additional curious invariant:

\begin{proposition}
Over the excentral family, the sum squared sidelines divided by the product of sidelines is constant. Furthermore it is equal to Joachimsthal's constant $J$ of its parent 3-periodic billiard family. Explicitly:

\[ \frac{\sum{(s_i')^2}}{\prod{s_i'}}=\frac{\sqrt{2\delta-a^2-b^2}}{c^2}={J} \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Derive explicit expressions for excentral sidelengths and arrive at claim via CAS simplification.
\end{proof}

Referring to \cref{fig:03-cos-circle}, the {\em cosine circle} of a triangle is defined in \cite[Cosine Circle]{mw} as being centered on the symmedian point $X_6$ and containing the 6 intersections of lines through $X_6$ parallel to the sides of the orthic triangle. Its radius $r^*$ is given by the product of sidelengths divided by the sum of their squares.

\begin{corollary}
The cosine circle of the excentral family is stationary with radius $r^*=1/J$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{pics_03_130_exc_cosine_circle.eps}
    \caption{The cosine circle (red) of the excentral family (green) is stationary. It contains the 6 intersections of lines (dashed blue) through the common center (family's $X_6$ and billiard periodics' $X_9$) which are parallel to their orthic, i.e., sidelines of billiard 3 periodics. \href{https://youtu.be/CrOSI8d8qDc}{Video}}
    \label{fig:03-cos-circle}
\end{figure}

  
\section{Incircle Family}
The incircle family, shown in \cref{fig:03-n3-affine}(middle), is the Poncelet family in a CAP pair for which the caustic is a circle (let $r$ denote its radius). It follows immediately that the family's incenter $X_1$ is stationary. Let $a,b$ be the axes of the ellipse the family is inscribed in. Cayley yields:

\begin{proposition}
The inradius $r$ of the incircle family is given by: 
\[ r=a_c=b_c=\frac{a b}{a+b} \]
\label{prop:03-incircle}
\end{proposition} 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{pics_03_160_incircle_circum.eps}
    \caption{A 3-periodic (blue) in the incircle family, and its fixed-radius circumcircle (purple). The locus of the circumcenter $X_3$ is a concentric circle (dashed purple). \href{https://bit.ly/3thddWK}{Live}}
    \label{fig:03-incircle-circum}
\end{figure}

As shown in \cref{fig:03-incircle-circum}:

\begin{proposition}
The incircle family has invariant circumradius given by $R=(a+b)/2$. Furthermore, the locus of its circumcenter $X_3$ is a circle of radius $d=R-b=a-R$ centered on the common center $O=X_1$.
\label{prop:n3-incircle-R}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $P_1=(x_1,y_1)$ be a first vertex of the incircle family. Using an explicit parametrization for $P_2$ and $P_3$, obtain via CAS the following coordinates for the moving circumcenter $X_3$:

{\scriptsize
\[
X_3=\frac{a-b}{2}\left[ - \,{\frac {x_1\, \left( -x_1^{2}
			\left( a+b \right) ^{2}+{a}^{2} b \left( 2\,a+b \right)  \right) }{ a
			\left(  \left( {a}^{2}-{b}^{2} \right) x_1^{2}+{a}^{2}{b}^{2}
			\right) }}
	 ,  {\frac { y_1\left( x_1^{2} \left( a+b
	 		\right) ^{2}-{a}^{2}{b}^{2} \right)}{b \left( {a}^{2}x_1^2+{b}^{2} \left( {a}^{2}-x_1^{2} \right)  \right) }}
	   \right]
 \]
 }

And circumradius $R=|P_1-X_3|=(a+b)/2$. Also obtain that the locus of $X_3$ is a circle concentric with the incircle and of radius $(a-b)/2$.
\end{proof}

Referring to \cref{eqn:02-sum-cos}: 

\begin{corollary}
The incircle family conserves its sum of cosines given by:
\[ \sum{\cos\theta_i}=1+\frac{r}{R}=\frac{{a}^2+4 {a}
   {b}+{b}^2}{({a}+{b})^2}\]
\label{cor:03-n3-inc-cos-sum}
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Confocal affine image} As \cref{fig:03-n3-affine}(middle) depicts, the incircle family can also be obtained from an affine image of billiard 3-periodics which sends the confocal caustic to a circle. Let $\alpha,\beta$ be the semi-axes of its billiard ellipse pre-image.

\begin{lemma}
The confocal family is sent to the incircle family by scaling it along the major axis by an amount $s$ given by:

\[ s=\frac{\beta (\bar{\delta}-\alpha^2+\beta^2)}{\alpha^3},\;\;\; \bar{\delta}=\sqrt{\alpha^4-(\alpha \beta)^2+\beta^4}\]

%\[ \lambda =\frac{(2a-r)\cdot r^3}{(a^2-r^2)\cdot (a-r)^2} \]
\label{lem:03-incircle-affine}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The scaled family will be inscribed in an ellipse with semi-axes $a = s \alpha$, and $b =\beta$. Its caustic will be the circle $r=b_c$, where $b_c={\beta\left({\alpha}^{2}-\bar{\delta}\right)}/(\alpha^2-\beta^2)$ is the confocal caustic minor axis given in \cref{prop:02-n3-caustic}. The Cayley condition for the incircle family imposes that $r=b_c=(a b)/(a + b)$, i.e., the result follows from solving $b_c = (s \alpha \beta)/(s \alpha + \beta)$ for $s$.

%The claim is obtained by imposing %$a_c^2-b_c^2=(s a)^2-b^2$ and solving %for $s^2$.
\end{proof}

\noindent Surprisingly:

\begin{proposition}
The sum of cosines conserved by the incircle family is identical to that conserved by billiard 3-periodics which are its affine pre-image.
\label{prop:03-incircle-same-sum-cos}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $s$ be the scaling along the major axis in \cref{lem:03-incircle-affine}. Plug $a=s \alpha$ and $b=\beta$ into  \cref{cor:03-n3-inc-cos-sum}, subtract one (to obtain $r/R$ for the incircle family) and verify it yields the expression in \cref{thm:02-confocal-rovR}.
\end{proof}

\section{Circumcircle Family}

The circumcircle family, shown in \cref{fig:03-n3-affine}(right), is the Poncelet family in a CAP pair for which the outer ellipse is a circle (let $R$ denote its radius). It follows immediately that the family's circumcenter $X_3$ is stationary. Let $a_c,b_c$ be the axes of its inellipse and $s_i$ the sidelengths. Cayley imposes $a_c+b_c=R$.

\begin{lemma}
Poncelet triangles in the circumcircle family are always acute.
\label{lem:03-circum-acute}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since the stationary circumcenter $X_3$ is interior to the caustic caustic, it will be interior to circumcircle family triangles, and the result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
The circumcircle family conserves the sum of squared sidelengths. This is given by:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^3 s_i^2=4(a_c + 2 b_c)(2 a_c + b_c) \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
%\textcolor{red}{ronaldo}
CAS-assisted simplification from the vertex parametrization in \cref{prop:03-vtx-param}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
The circumcircle family conserves the product of its internal angle cosines. This is given by:
\[ \prod_{i=1}^3{\cos\theta_i}=\frac{a_c b_c}{2(a_c+b_c)^2}=\frac{a_c b_c}{2 R^2}\]
\label{prop:03-circum-cos-prod}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
CAS-assisted simplification from vertex parametrization.
\end{proof}

Recall the orthic triangle has vertices at the feet a triangle's altitudes. Let $R_h$ denote its circumradius. In , see \cite[Orthic Triangle, Eqn 7]{mw}, one finds the relation $R_h=R/2$. Therefore $R_h$ is invariant over the circumcircle family. Let $r_h$ denote the orthic's inradius. Referring to \cref{fig:03-circum-orthic}:

%Referring to Figure~\ref{fig:II-poristic} (left):

\begin{proposition}
Over the circumcircle family  $r_h$ is invariant and  given by $r_h=a_c b_c/(a_c+b_c)$. 
\label{prop:03-circumcircle-rh}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
In \cite[Orthic Triangle, Eqn. 5]{mw} one finds the relation  $r_h=2 R \prod_{i=1}^3{\cos\theta_i}$. Recalling $R=a_c+b_c$, substitution into \cref{prop:03-circum-cos-prod} yields the claim.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{pics_03_140_circum_orthic.eps}
    \caption{A circumcircle family 3-periodic (blue) and its orthic triangle (orange). Over the family the orthic's circumcircle (dashed orange) and incircle (dashed green) have invariant radii. Also shown are their centers $X_{3,h}$ and $X_{1,h}$ which, for any reference triangle, correspond the nine-point center $X_5$ and orthocenter $X_1$. \href{https://youtu.be/wUu2iMesv3U}{Video}, \href{https://bit.ly/2PHJZma}{Live}}
    \label{fig:03-circum-orthic}
\end{figure}


Referring to  \cref{fig:03-circum-orthic}, it can be shown (see \cref{ex:03-circum-x5-locus}):

\begin{lemma}
Over the circumcircle family, the locus of the orthic circumcenter (i.e., the 9-point center $X_5$ of the family) is a circle concentric with the pair.
\label{lem:03-circum-x5-locus}
\end{lemma}

%Below we analyze a Poncelet family with fixed incircle and non-concentric fixed circumcircle, known as the ``poristic'' family. The previous result implies that the orthics derived from the circumcircle family can be regarded as a rigidly moving poristic family.

\subsection{Confocal affine image} As \cref{fig:03-n3-affine}(right) depicts, the circumcircle family can also be obtained from an affine image of billiard 3-periodics which sends the billiard ellipse with semi-axes $\alpha,\beta$ to a circle with radius $R=\beta$. Therefore billiard 3-periodics are sent to the circumcircle family by scaling it along the major axis by an amount $s'={\beta/\alpha}$. Therefore \cref{prop:02-n3-caustic} implies:

\begin{lemma}
The caustic semi-axes $a_c,b_c$ of the circumcircle family which is the $s'$-affine image of the confocal family are given by:

\[ a_c=\frac{\beta}{\alpha}{\alpha_c}=\frac{\beta(\bar{\delta}-\beta^2)}{\alpha^2-\beta^2},\;\;\;b_c=\beta_c=\frac{\beta(\alpha^2-\bar{\delta})}{\alpha^2-\beta^2} \]
where $\alpha_c,\beta_c$ are the caustic semi-axes of the confocal pre-image, and $\alpha,\beta,\bar{\delta}$ are as previously defined.
\label{lem:03-circumcircle-affine}
\end{lemma}

\noindent Note that the $s'$-affine image of billiard excentrals becomes a Poncelet family with fixed incircle; see \cref{fig:03-n3-affine}(right, dashed green triangles). We have seen above such a family conserves its sum of cosines. Suprisingly, the following invariant ``role reversal'' takes place:

\begin{proposition}
The sum of cosines conserved by billiard 3-periodics is the same as the one conserved by the $s'$-affine image of billiard excentrals. Furthermore product of cosines conserved by billiard excentrals is the same as the one conserved by the $s'$-affine image of billiard 3-periodics (circumcircle family).   \label{prop:03-n3-role-reversal}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For the first statement it suffices to show that the $s'$-affine image of billiard excentrals has sides parallel to those of the $s$-image of billiard 3-periodics, i.e., the incircle family and use \cref{prop:03-incircle-same-sum-cos}. The second statement can be proved algebraically from vertex parametrizaton.
\end{proof}

\section{Homothetic Family}
 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics_03_150_n3_homothetic.eps}
    \caption{A 3-periodic (blue) interscribed between two homothetic ellipses (black, brown). Since this family is an affine image of one of equilaterals interscribed between two concentric circles, (i) the barycenter $X_2$ is stationary at the common center, and (ii) the area is conserved. Also conserved is (iii) the sum of squared sidelengths. (ii) and (iii) imply the Brocard angle $\omega$ is invariant. Also shown are the two (moving) the Brocard points $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$. \href{https://youtu.be/2fvGd8wioZY}{Video}, \href{https://bit.ly/3aYnrVM}{Live}}
    \label{fig:03-homoth-brocard}
\end{figure}

The homothetic family, shown in \cref{fig:03-homoth-brocard}, is the Poncelet family in a CAP pair for which the outer and inner ellipse are homothetic to each other, i.e., $a = k a_c$ and $b = k b_c$, where $a,b$ and $a_c,b_c$ are outer and inner ellipse semi-axes, respectively. Cayley implies:

\begin{proposition}
The semi-axes of a CAP pair of homothetic ellipses which admits a 3-periodic are given by:
\[ a_c = \frac{a}{2},\;\;\;b_c=\frac{b}{2} \]
\label{prop:03-homothetic-cayley}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
The barycenter $X_2$ is stationary at the common center and area $A$ is invariant and given by:
\[A= \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} a b \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Consider an affine transformation that sends both outer and inner ellipse to a unit circle, e.g., by scaling the system along the major (resp. minor) axis by $1/a$ (resp. $1/b$). Uniquely amongst all triangle centers, the barycenter $X_2$ is invariant under affine transformations. By symmetry of the equilateral centroid, it will be identified with the center of the homothetic pair. Affine transformations preserve area ratios, so $A$ will be the the area of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a unit circle scaled by the inverse Jacobian $a b$. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

Curiously, the homothetic family shares the following invariant with the circumcircle family:

\begin{proposition}
Over the homothetic family, the sum of squared sidelengths $s_i^2$ is invariant and given by:
	
\[ \sum_{i=1}^3 s_i^2=\frac{9}{2} \left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right) \]
\end{proposition}

The proof below was kindly contributed by  \cite{sergei2020-private-sidelengths}.

\begin{proof}
Invariant sum of squared sidelengths follows from the fact that the average of the harmonics of degree 1 and 2 over the group of rotations of order 3 is zero. Namely, consider a unit vector $v(\varphi)=(\cos \varphi, \sin \varphi)$ and a matrix $\mathcal{A}$ taking concentric circles to homothetic ellipses. Then $|\mathcal{A}v(\varphi)|^2$ is a trigonometric polynomial of degree 2. Average it over $\mathbb{Z}_3$ by adding $2\pi/3$ and $4\pi/3$ to $\varphi$. The result is independent of $\varphi$, as needed. The actual value is obtained via CAS simplification from vertex parametrization.
\end{proof}

Referring to \cref{fig:03-homoth-brocard}, recall the definition of a triangle's Brocard angle $\omega$, given in \cite[Brocard Angle]{mw}: sidelines $P_i P_{i+1}$ rotated about $P_i$ by some angle $\theta$ will only concur (at the first Brocard point $\Omega_1$) if $\theta=\omega$. A second, distinct Brocard point $\Omega_2$ exists if sidelines $P_i P_{i-1}$ are rotated about $P_{i}$ by $-\omega$.

A known relation appearing in \cite[Brocard Angle, Eqn. 2]{mw} is $\cot\omega=(\sum_{i=1}^3 s_i^2)/(4 A)$. Therefore:

\begin{corollary}
Over the homothetic family, the Brocard angle $\omega$ is invariant. Its cotangent is given by:
\[ \cot\omega=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}{a b} \]	
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Direct calculations using the explicit parametrization of homothetic vertices.
\end{proof}

\noindent Another known relation valid for any triangle is $\cot\omega=\sum\cot\theta_i$:

\begin{corollary}
The homothetic family conserves the sum of its internal angle cotangents.
\end{corollary}

\section{Dual Family}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{pics_03_120_dual_w_orthic.eps}
    \caption{A Dual family 3-periodic (blue) interscribed in a pair of ``dual'' ellipse (black, brown). Their aspect ratios are reciprocals of each other. No invariants have yet been detected for this family other than the fact that the orthocenter $X_4$ is stationary at the common center. Also shown is the orthic triangle (dashed orange) whose vertices lie at the feet of the altitudes (dashed blue). \href{https://bit.ly/337wTBS}{Live}}
    \label{fig:03-n3-dual}
\end{figure}

%\textcolor{red}{Quem e o dual: é aquele cuja caustica é anti-homotetica a externa, ou seja $a'/b'=b/a$}

The dual family, shown in \cref{fig:03-n3-dual}, is the Poncelet family in a CAP pair such that the outer and inner ellipses are ``duals'' curves of each other, i.e., tangents to one are sent to points on the other and vice-versa. For ellipses, this simply implies their aspect ratios $a/b$ and $a_c/b_c$ will be reciprocals of one another. Cayley yields:

\begin{proposition}
The caustic semi-axes of the dual family are given by:
\[ a_c=\lambda\,b,\;\;\;b_c=\lambda\,a,\;\;\;\lambda=\frac{a b}{a^2+b^2} \]
\label{prop:03-dual-cayley}
\end{proposition}

Remarkably:

\begin{proposition}
The orthocenter $X_4$ of the dual family is stationary.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Follows directly from the vertex parametrization in \cref{prop:03-vtx-param}.

In terms of the vertices of a triangle $A=[x_a,y_a]$, $B=[x_b,y_b]$, $C=[x_c,y_c]$ the orthocenter $X_4=[x_{4n}/A_4,y_{4n}/A_4]$ is given by the following rational functions 

\begin{align*}
    x_{4n}&=   \left(x_c-x_b\right) x_a\,y_a+ \left( 
 x_b\,y_b-x_c\,y_c \right) x_a+ \left( y_c-y_b \right) y_a^2+ \left( y_b^2-{y_c}^{2} \right) y_a\\
&+  x_cx_b\left( \,y_c- \,y_b)
 \right) +y_by_c( y_c-y_b) \\
 \\
 y_{4n}&=  \left(x_b-x_c\right) x_a^2+ \left( y_b-y_c \right) x_a\,y_a+ \left( x_c^2-x_b^2\right) x_a+ \left( -x_b\,y_b+x_c\,y_c \right) y_a\\
 &+x_b  x_c(x_b- \,x_c)+ y_b\,y_c(x_b-x_c) \\
 %
A_4&= \left(y_b-y_c \right) x_a+ \left( -x_b+x_c\right) y_a+x_b\,y_c-x_c\,y_b
\end{align*}

The results follows from CAS-assisted simplification from the vertex parametrization in \cref{prop:03-vtx-param}.
\end{proof}

Despite much searching, no invariant quantities have yet been found for this family.

\section{Vertex parametrization for a generic CAP pair}
\label{sec:03-cap-vtx-param}

Consider a general CAP pair of ellipses denoted $\E$ and $\E_c$. We will derive a generic parametrization for the vertices of 3-periodics in such a pair. A first calculation will be helpful. Referring to \cref{fig:ell-ints}(left):

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics_03_070_ell_ints.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Left:} Two CAP ellipses (black and brown), and a point $P_1$ on the outer one. The lines thru $P_1$ tangent to the inner ellipse intersect the outer one at $P_2$ and $P_3$. Notice that $P_2 P_3$ cut thru the inner ellipse, i.e., the pair of ellipses does not satisfy Cayley's conditions. \textbf{Right:} the minor axis of the inner ellipse has been scaled such that $P_1 P_2 P_3$ is now a Poncelet triangle.}
    \label{fig:ell-ints}
\end{figure}

\begin{proposition}
The intersections $P_2$ and $P_3$ on $\E$ of the two tangents to $\E_c$ seen from a point $P_1=[x_1,y_1]$ also on $\E$ are given by:

\begin{align*}
    P_2& =[x_2,y_2]=\frac{1}{k_2}\left[\frac{p_1 x_1 + p_2 y_1}{b} ,  \frac{-w_1 x_1 + w_2 y_1}{a} \right] \\
    P_3&=[x_3,y_3]=\frac{1}{k_2}\left[\frac{p_1 x_1 - p_2 y_1}{b},\frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 y_1}{a}\right]
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    p_1 &=b\left(a^4  b_c^4 -(a^2 -  a_c^2)^2 b^4 \right) \\
    p_2 &= 2 a  \left( (a^2 + a_c^2)b^2 - a^2b_c^2  \right) k_1 \\
    k_1&=\sqrt{ b^2  b_c^2 (a^2 -  a_c^2)  x_1^2 +  a_c^2 a^2(b^2 -  b_c^2)  y_1^2}\\
    k_2 &=\left(\frac{a^2 (b^2 +  b_c^2) - a_c^2 b^2 }{a}x_1\right)^2+ \left(\frac{a^2 (b^2 -  b_c^2) + a_c^2b^2 }{b} y_1\right)^2\\
    w_1&=2 b \left( (b^2 +  b_c^2) a^2 - a_c^2 b^2\right) k_1 \\
    w_2&= a\left(a_c^4b^4-a^4(b^2-b_c^2)^2\right)
     %=-a (a^2( b^2 -    b_c^2) -  a_c^2 %b^2) (a^2 (b^2 -   b_c^2) +  a_c^2 b^2)
\end{align*}
\label{prop:03-vtx-param}
\end{proposition}

Parametrizations for specific CAP families can be obtained from \cref{prop:03-vtx-param} by setting the caustic semi-axes $a_c$, $b_c$ as in \cref{tab:03-cap-vtx}.

\caption{Information about the caustic to various CAP families, regarded as a fixed inconic. The Brianchon point is the perspector to the triangle whose vertices are at the touchpoints with the inconic, see \cite[Brianchon point]{mw}. When named, this triangel appears in the ``caustic contact tri'' column. An link to an animation for each case is provided.}
