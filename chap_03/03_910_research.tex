\begin{question}
Referring to \cref{fig:03-n3-dual}, are there any conserved quantities for the dual family besides stationarity of $X_4$ at the common center?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Referring to  the dashed green triangle in \cref{fig:03-n3-affine}(middle), are there any conserved quantities and/or fixed triangle centers for the family which is an $s$-affine image of billiard excentrals?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Consider the family of inversive images of excentral triangles with respect to a circle centered at a point $M$ in the plane. Show the symmedian point $X_6$ of such a family will be stationary regardless of $M$. Compute the location of $X_6$. See this curious phenomenon in a \href{https://youtu.be/wwX_QfkjVi0}{Video}.
