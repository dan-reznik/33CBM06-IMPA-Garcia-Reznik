\section{Research Questions}

\begin{question}
Referring to \cref{fig:03-n3-dual}, are there any conserved quantities for the dual family besides stationarity of $X_4$ at the common center?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Referring to  the dashed green triangle in \cref{fig:03-n3-affine}(middle), are there any conserved quantities and/or fixed triangle centers for the family which is an $s$-affine image of billiard excentrals?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
\textcolor{red}{inversive}
Consider the family of inversive images of excentral triangles with respect to a circle centered at a point $M$ in the plane. Show the symmedian point $X_6$ of such a family will be stationary regardless of $M$. Compute the location of $X_6$. See this curious phenomenon in a \href{https://youtu.be/wwX_QfkjVi0}{Video}.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Consider the homothetic family and its polar image with respect to a focus of the outer ellipse $\E$. Prove that (i) the caustic is a circle, derive its location and radius. (ii) the family is inscribed in a conic, namely, below (resp. above) a certain aspect ratio $a/b$ of $\E$, the conic is an an ellipse (resp. hyperbola). (iii) the Gergonne point $X_7$ of the family is stationary.

\begin{question}
Prove that a necessary condition for a triangle center to be stationary over Poncelet 3-periodics is that it lies on the Thomson Cubic \cite{gibert2021-thomson}. 
\end{question}

\begin{question}
$X_k$, $k=1,2,3,4,6,9$ lie on the Thomson cubic $K_{002}$ and as seen above, are stationary over Poncelet families centered on them. Referring to \cref{fig:03-x1249}, prove that $X_{1249}$, also on $K_{002}$, is stationary over Poncelet 3-periodics centered on it. Show that in the $X_{1249}$-centered system, $X_4$ (resp. $X_{20}$) is the perspector of the circumconic (resp. inconic). 
\label{que:03-x1249}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
The perspector of a circumconic centered on $X$ is the $X_2$-Ceva conjugate of $X$. Likewise, the perspector (Brianchon point) of an inconic centered on $X$ is the isotomic conjugate of the anticomplement of $X$. Given a triangle, let $C$ and $I$ be the $X$-centered circumconic and inconic. Show that for a triangle, the inconic perspector (i.e., the Brianchon point) is the anticomplement of the circumconic one.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
In \cite{gibert2021-thomson} it is stated that if $X_k$ lies on the Thomson cubic $K_{002}$, circumconic normals at the vertices (and inconic normals at the contact points) concur. Consider the (axis-parallel, concentric) circumconic and inconic pair centered on $X_{1249}$. Prove that the circumconic (resp. inconic) normals at the vertices (resp. contact points) meet at $X_{20}$ (resp. $X_{1498}$).
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Consider the following triangle centers in \cite{gibert2021-thomson} which lie on the Thomson cubic: $X_k$, $k=$57, 223, 282, 1073, 3341, 3342, 3343, 3344, 3349, 3350, 3351, 3352, 3356, 14481. Experimentally they are not stationary over Poncelet 3-periodics centered on them. Why is that? Conversely, why is it that $X_k$, $k=$1,2,3,4,6,9,1249 , also on the Thomson, can be stationary?

    \caption{A Poncelet 3-periodic (blue) interscribed between the $X_{1249}$-centered circumconic $\Cm$ (black) and inconic $\I$ (brown); over the family, said center remains stationary. Since the center lies on the Thomson cubic, (i) $\Cm$ and $\I$ are axis-parallel, (ii) the normals to $\Cm$ at the vertices concur (at $X_{20}$ in this case), and (iii) the normals to $\I$ at the contact points also concur (at $X_{1498}$). It turns out $X_{20}$ doubles up as the Brianchon point of $\I$, and $X_4$ is the perspector of $\Cm$, i.e., the perspector of its polar triangle (magenta) with respect to $\Cm$. \href{https://youtu.be/QQSN\_ndDJQk}{Video}}

\begin{question}
Given a triangle, compute its $X_7$-centered inconic and circumconic. Prove that 3-periodics interscribed in said conics will not maintain $X_7$ stationary. Prove the same by taking the conic pair's center to be $X_8$ and $X_{10}$, i.e., in neither of these cases will the original center remain stationary. Report the Brianchon point for all said inconics.
