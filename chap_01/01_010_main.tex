This research started upon conversations with Jair Koiller about the geometry of elliptic billiard trajectories, following one author's recent work in control of heliostat fields for solar energy plants\footnote{Such fields are in fact a discretized/flattened focusing paraboloid, see \cite{sundrop2016,esolar2017}.}; see \cite{gross2020-solar} for a recent publication. An early, na√Øve experimental artifact was an animation of 3-periodics in the elliptic billiard along with the locus of their incenter; see  \cite{dsr_vid11incenter}. A natural choice given that each vertex is bisected by the ellipse normal. At the time we did not know this locus could be an ellipse, and indeed, how rare a find this is (we have conjecture that amongst the 5d space of possible ellipse pairs, only in the confocal pair -- a 1d subspace -- can the locus of the incenter be a conic). A twin animation was also produced depicting the self-intersected locus of the intouchpoints; see \cite{dsr_vid11e}.

Shortly thereafter \cite{olga14} produced a proof using methods of complex algebraic geometry.
%by complexification of the phenomenon. 
This was followed by an alternative    proof using techniques of real analytic   geometry given explicitly the equation of the locus; see \cite{garcia2019-incenter}. The loci centroids of Poncelet polygons was studied in \cite{schwartz2016-com}. In  \cite{garcia2019-incenter} the centroid locus was given explicitly.  Also \cite{corentin2021-circum} and \cite{garcia2018} proved that the locus of the circumcenter over billiard 3-periodics is also an ellipse.

    \caption{Trajectory regimes in the elliptic billiard. \textbf{Top left}: The first four segments of a trajectory departing at $P_1$ and moving toward $P_2$, bouncing at $P_i, i=2,3,4$. At each bounce the normal $\hat{n}_i$ bisects incoming and outgoing segments. Joachimsthal's integral \cite{sergei91} means all segments are tangent to a confocal {\em caustic} (brown). \textbf{Top right}: All 3-periodic orbits are tangent to a confocal caustic (brown). \textbf{Bottom}: The first 50 segments of a non-periodic trajectory starting at $P_1$ and directed toward $P_2$. Segments are tangent to a confocal ellipse (left) or hyperbola (right). The former (respectively, latter) occurs if $P_1P_2$ passes outside (respectively, between) the elliptic billiard's foci (black dots).}
