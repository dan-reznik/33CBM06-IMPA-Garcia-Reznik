\begin{exercise}
   Consider an elliptic billiard $\mathcal{E}$ having a family of 3-periodic orbits given by $\Delta(t)=\{P_1(t),P_2(t),P_3(t)\}$. Denote by $\Delta_c(t)=\{Q_1(t),Q_2(t),Q_3(t)\}$ the vertices of the polar triangle (also it is the extouch triangle of $\Delta(t)$) inscribed in the caustic $\mathcal{E}_1$ (Mandart innelipse of $\Delta(t)$).  Find explicitly the envelope $\mathcal{E}_2$ of the family of lines $\ell_{ij}(u,t)=uQ_i(t)+(1-u)Q_j(t)$ $(i\ne j=1,2,3)$. Show that $\{\mathcal{E}_1,\mathcal{E}_2\}$ is a Poncelet pair.
   
   In the three dimensional space of triangles inscribed in an ellipse analyze the properties of the   curves $ \Delta(t)$ and $ \Delta_c(t).$
