\begin{exercise} In the homothetic pair we have that a vertex of a $N$-periodic orbit is given $P_k(t)=[a\cos(t+2 k\pi/N ), b\sin(t+2k\pi/N)].$ 

\noindent i) Show that the envelope of congruence of lines
defined by $P_{k}(t)P_{k+1}(t)$ is an ellipse.

\noindent ii) Generalize item i) for the congruence defined by $P_{k}(t)P_{k+l}(t)$.
