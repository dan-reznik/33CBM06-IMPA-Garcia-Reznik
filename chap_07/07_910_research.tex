\begin{question}
In \cref{que:02-extouch} one is asked to prove that the family of billiard 3-periodic extouch triangles is Ponceletian. Prove that over this family the loci of $X_k$, $k=2,3,4,5,20$ are ellipses, derive their semi-axes. See it \href{https://bit.ly/2RdtlvH}{Live}.

Prove (or disprove) \cref{conj:07-locus}.

\begin{question}
Recall 3-periodics in the Brocard porism, \cref{sec:04-broc-porism}. The Brianchon point of the Brocard inellipse is (stationary) $X_6$, i.e., family sidelines touch the inellipse at the vertices of the $X_6$-cevian, in \cite{mw} called the {\em symmedial} triangle \cite{mw}. Show  that over Brocard porism 3-periodics, (i) the symmedial triangles are Ponceletian, (ii) compute the center and semi-axes of its inellipse, (iii) show that the locus of $X_k$, $k=13,14,15,16$ are circles. See it \href{https://bit.ly/3hXos4E}{Live}.
