\begin{exercise}\label{ex:1chap1}
Let $P=[p:q:r] $ be an interior point of an equilateral triangle $T=ABC$.

\noindent i) Show that the distances of $P$ to the sidelines of the triangle $T$ are given by
\[ [pk,qk,rk], \;\;\;k=\frac{2\Delta}{pa+qb+rc}\]
where $\Delta$ is the area of the triangle.

 \noindent ii)
 Show that  $k(p+q+r)$ is equal to the length of the triangle's altitude, i.e., the sum is independent of the position of the point.
 
 \noindent iii) Show that the same result is true when $P$ is an exterior point, but here we need to consider distances with signal, according to the position of $P$. See \cref{fig:trilinear_signal}.
 
 \noindent iv) Show that the reciprocal is true, i.e., if the sum of distances is independent of the point, then the triangle is equilateral.
 
 \noindent iv) Generalize items ii), iii) and iv)  for regular polygons.

         Show that the Brocard points can be  constructed as shown in \cref{fig:brocard_construction}.
         
         Consider a triangle $ABC$ and draw a line passing through $A$ and parallel to $BC$. Consider also a circle passing through $C$ and tangent to the line $AB$ at the vertex $A$. The point $D$ is the intersection of the line and circle constructed above.  The line $BD$ intersect the circle at the Brocard point $\Omega_1$ of $ABC$. Repeat this construction for the other vertices and obtain $\Omega_2.$

 \begin{exercise}
 A    similarity    about a point $O$   is a composition of a
rotation and a dilation, both centered at $O$.
Consider a quadrilateral   $ABCD$  which is not a parallelogram.  

Show that there is a unique   similarity sending $AC$ to $BD$. 

Let $A, B, C, D$  be four distinct point in the plane, such that $AC$ is not parallel to $BD$. Let $X$ be the the intersection of
  $ AC$ and $BD$.  Let the circumcircles of $ABX $ and $CDX$ meet again at $O$. Then $O$  is the
center of the unique   similarity that sends $A $ to $C$ and $B $ to $D$.

If $O$ is the center of the   similarity that sends $A$ to $C$ and $B$ to $D$, then $O$ is also the center
of the   similarity that sends $A$ to $B$ and $C$ to $  D$.
